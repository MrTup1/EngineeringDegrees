          <button type = "button" class = "menuButton menuTop">Do you need to be good at maths to apply for Engineering?</button>
          <div class="paragraphText menuContent ">
              Yes, you have to be confident with mathematics in order to prosper in top universities. In fact, most applicants complete Further Mathematics in their A Levels. Most Universities do not necessarily require Further Mathematics, but not taking Further Mathematics will guarantee a lot of stress in University, as you have to catch up.

          <button type = "button" class = "menuButton">Are there more degrees than the ones displayed here?</button>
          <div class="paragraphText menuContent ">
            Yes, there are many more courses than the 11 main degrees displayed here. These 11 degrees merely encompasses most courses, and are the primary pillars in engineering. For example, Mechatronics Engineering is a combination of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering applied to Robotics. Other courses are usually just a specialisation or combination of the 11 degrees, which have their own dedicated webpage.

          </button>
          <div class="paragraphText menuContent ">
            Top universities tend to look for Leadership, Creativity and Team Work in aspiring engineers. Therefore, any demonstration of these skills will make you stand out as an applicant.

          <button type = "button" class = "menuButton">Are there differences between what UK and US universities are looking for? 
          </button>
          <div class="paragraphText menuContent ">
            Yes. The general factors for the UK and US universities are quite different. UK schools tend to focus on academic strength, and extracurriculars that relate to the course that you are applying to. In contrast, US universities tend to look for all rounded individuals who excel in many different areas, so it’s very important to do activities not only academically related.

          </button>
          <div class="paragraphText menuContent ">
            There are many courses even within the United Kingdom that combine multiple degrees into one single course. It is very important to decide which course will be the perfect fit for you, which will be very challenging. First and foremost, head to the Degree Suggestor to narrow down your research options quickly.
