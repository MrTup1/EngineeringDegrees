      <div class = paragraphText id = hook> Are you interested in applying Science into the real world? Then you should definitely consider Engineering as an option for University and beyond. All forms of Engineering aim to solve problems through a plethora of different principles, which would be acquired mostly during University. By picking an Engineering Degree, you will be able to help many individuals daily and tackle challenging problems. You can make a direct impact on many peopleâ€™s lives.  </div>

          <div class="paragraphText menuContent ">
              Yes, you have to be confident with mathematics in order to prosper in top universities. In fact, most applicants complete Further Mathematics in their A Levels. Most Universities do not necessarily require Further Mathematics, but not taking Further Mathematics will guarantee a lot of stress in University to catch up.

          <button type = "button" class = "menuButton">Are there more degrees than the ones displayed here?</button>
          <div class="paragraphText menuContent ">
            Yes, there are many more courses than the 11 main degrees displayed here. These 11 degrees merely encompasses most courses, and are the primary pillars in engineering. For example, Mechatronics Engineering is a combination of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering applied to Robotics. Other courses are usually just a specialisation or combination of the 11 degrees, which have their own dedicated webpage.
