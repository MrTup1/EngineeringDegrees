      <div class = headerText> What do the Statistics mean? </div>
      <div class = paragraphText> <b>Salary:</b> Median Salary within the countries <br> <b>Total Employed:</b> All currently held positions that have the engineering title (The larger the more job opportunities, but note that these jobs only account for the title for example "Mechanical Engineer")<br> <b>Job Growth: </b> Expected increase in the total amount of jobs in the next 10 years in the form of a percentage (The higher the better, means there is an increasing demand for the job) <br> <b>Replacement Rate:</b> Total degrees added into the job market divided by the number of job openings per year (This is a measurement of job saturation, the lower the value the better. A value under 100% means there are more job openings than the supply, causing a shortage. A value higher than 200% is not a good degree as there are 2 people competing for 1 job opening on average.)</div>

      <div class = headerText> Background </div>
      <div class = paragraphText> Hello I am Daniel Look, creator of the website Engineering Degrees. I am currently in the Lower Sixth within Dulwich College. I always had a passion for building things that would have real world applications, such as this website.</div>

      <div class = line> </div>

      <div class = headerText> Why did you make this website?</div>
      <div class = paragraphText> 
        As I was surfing the web for introductions on Engineering Degrees, I noticed that there was an extreme lack of insightful information on this topic. As a student applying to Universities, this was extremely frustrating. Thus, I went out to create this Website. The overall goal of this website is to save some of your time researching for which degree to apply for, and hopefully lower the amount of courses you will need to research. </div>

      <div class = line> </div>
