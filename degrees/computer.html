            <div class = jobContent>•	Software Engineering is a subset of Computer Science, and only deals with the practical elements designing software. However, a Computer Science degree is heavily advised as even if you’re only interested in the applications of coding, Computer Science covers much more background knowledge such as complex mathematics that allows you to create software at a higher level.   </div>
