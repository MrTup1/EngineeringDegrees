            <div class = jobContent> If you’re interested in designing electronics or creating electrical systems, you should consider Electrical engineering. It is the study of engineering dealing with the design, iterative development and manufacture of any electronics and electrical equipment. They work on engineering power systems, designing radar systems, designing circuit boards for almost everything around you and so much more. </div>

            <div class = "subHeader"> Electronics Engineer  </div>
              <div class = "jobContent" > Most graduates either become an electrical or electronics engineer. They mainly design electronic circuits to meet specific requirements. In the circuit, they integrate all sorts of electronic devices such as semiconductors, microprocessors, and microcontrollers.  </div>

            <div class = "subHeader"> Power Systems Engineer </div>
              <div class = "jobContent" >Power systems engineers are responsible for designing the electrical transmission systems that transfer energy from energy sources to power grids. Additionally, they may also evaluate transmission feasibility and overall system impact of the power system.   </div>

              <div class = "jobContent" > Network Engineers’ main objective is to ensure the networks of a firm are running smoothly. They establish network topologies to improve network efficiency, monitor network traffic for packet losses (data loss), then troubleshoot the problem with a devised plan. Many also configure both the hardware and software of the organization which includes servers, switches, routers, and other hardware.  </div>
