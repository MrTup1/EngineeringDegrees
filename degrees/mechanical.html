            <div class = jobContent> If you’re interested in moving parts and designing physical components, Mechanical Engineering is worth diving into. Mechanical engineering is the study of objects and systems in motion. It’s the study of machinery, and how to manufacture and maintain it at all levels. Mechanical engineering is a branch of engineering that deals with the design, manufacturing, and maintenance of mechanical systems, devices, and machinery. Mechanical engineers use their knowledge of mechanics, thermodynamics, and materials science to develop and improve a wide range of products and processes..</div>
            <div class = "headerText bigHeader"> What do Mechanical Engineers do? </div>
            <div class = jobContent> Mechanical Engineering is a very broad profession, every engineer will have a different experience working. Most engineers are either responsible for designing, analysing and overseeing projects involving moving components. You can either specialise in a particular field (e.g. Thermodynamics…) or be a generalist. They use CAD (Computer Aided Design) regularly in their workflow and use an array of different software to test their design’s effectiveness by running simulations. </div>
