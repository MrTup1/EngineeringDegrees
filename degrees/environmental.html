            <div class = jobContent>If you want to make actual positive changes towards the environment, environmental engineering is for you. Environmental Engineers use principles of engineering to develop solutions to environmental problems such as global warming haunting us today.  </div>
            <div class = "headerText bigHeader individualHeaderTop">Environmental Engineering VS Civil Engineering   </div>
            <div class = jobContent>Environmental Engineering is extremely similar compared to Civil Engineering, but there are differences. There major difference is in how environmental engineers will learn about chemistry and biology while civil engineers focus on different infrastructures such as trains. Environmental Engineers also typically learn about advanced water supply systems. Many universities only offer this course as a master as there is so much overlap, or combine it with civil engineering. </div>
