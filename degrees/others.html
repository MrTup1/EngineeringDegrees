                <div class="jobContent">A degree combining mechanical engineering and electrical engineering. Moreover, this degree specialises in the field of robotics. However, this degree is similar to biomedical engineering meaning you will not be skilled at one particular field. Many job opportunities will be shut down because mechanical or electrical engineers does the job better. </div>

                <div class="jobContent">A degree that some Universities offer as many students are not sure what they are interested in. However, it is strongly advised that students take mechanical engineeering instead, as general engineering does not have many job opportunities due to its "jack of all trade" nature.</div>
