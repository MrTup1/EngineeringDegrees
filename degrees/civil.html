            <div class = jobContent> If you’re interested in building large scale infrastructure that everyone can see, then civil engineering is for you. Civil engineers build everything around us, this includes roads, railways, offices, schools, hospitals and much more. They are essential for society to function in the modern era. </div>
            <div class = "headerText bigHeader individualHeaderTop"> Is Civil Engineering a job? </div>
            <div class = jobContent> No, most often the case, universities will require you to specialize into one particular area such as structures, transportation… Then those specializations will unlock the key to jobs within the job market.  </div>

            <div class = "subHeader"> Transportation Engineer  </div>
              <div class = "jobContent" >Transportation engineers design networking systems that allow humans to safely travel from place A to place B. This can be in the form of mass transit, subways, seaways, bridges and any other medium. Transportation Engineers always identify traffic problems first and design a construction plan as a solution to the problem. The plan has to account for a plethora of factors such as budgets, different stakeholders (contractors, government, public) and ensure everything follows country regulations.  </div>   
            <div class = mainLine> </div>
            <div class = "subHeader"> City Engineer </div>
              <div class = "jobContent" > City Engineers are engineers employed by the cities’ government. They are generalists as they can design any infrastructure project such as roads, bridges or even buildings. Their most important role is to be a manager in a large-scale infrastructure project. However, they also plan their budgets, supervise the infrastructure site and present construction progress to contractors and stakeholders.     </div>

            <div class = "subHeader"> Structural Engineer  </div>
              <div class = "jobContent" >As the name suggests, structural engineers mainly work on ensuring the structural integrity of any proposed construction, ensuring it meets safety and health standards. Structural engineers usually employ computer simulations to test how structures act in different conditions, then calculate the breaking stress of a specific building. Then, they will advise suitable materials to use for the construction.    </div>

            <div class = "subHeader"> Geotechnical Engineer </div>
              <div class = "jobContent" > Geotechnical engineers focus on engineering behavior of earth materials. They employ their knowledge of soil and rock to evaluate the risks associated with infrastructure projects. They access potential risks such as landslides, earthquakes, and other risks. Then design a solution to stabilize the soil used for construction.   </div>
