            <div class = jobContent> If you’re interested in any flying aircraft such as planes or designing rockets, Aerospace or Aeronautical Engineering should be your priority. Aerospace engineering is the study of engineering dealing with the design, iterative development and manufacture of any aircraft or spacecraft. Their main diverging branches are Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering. </div>
            <div class = "headerText bigHeader">What is the difference between Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering?  </div>
            <div class = jobContent> Aeronautical Engineering deals with aircrafts below the Earth’s atmosphere such as airplanes while Astronautical Engineering deals with aircraft above the Earth’s atmosphere, such as rockets, satellites… </div>

              <div class = "jobContent" > Aeronautical engineers design, create and maintain aircraft such as helicopters and missiles. They frequently carry out investigations of the aircraft to check for any structural faults by conducting simulations with flight and weather condition, to guarantee that the aircraft is safe for human use. In addition, they also often maintain and repair aircraft after recent damage.   </div>
