            <div class = jobContent>This degree in many universities is a jack of all trades engineering degree, meaning you study mechanical, electrical, chemical and biology concepts, but will not be a master at any of them. This means it may be harder for you to get a job as many employers look for mechanical/electrical/chemical engineers instead. Furthermore, this degree limits which industry you will work in.  </div>
